## 🧠 Game Concept

Kivi blends classic dice mechanics with board strategy. Players roll 6 dice, lock combinations, and place a stone on a matching square type. Each square has a rule-based requirement (e.g. “All Even”, “≥30”, “Full House”) and point value. The goal: earn the highest score by smart placement and combo planning.
